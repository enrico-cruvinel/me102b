(Inspired by ModBUS)
Baud rates is 115200
Message is ended with CRLF '\r\n' (carriage return and line feed)

All messages should be 5 characters long, with the format
char 0-3: device identifier (i.e. IMU, MOT, etc.)
char 4: function code (read or write identifier)
char 5: zeroth data bit
char 6: first data bit
char 7: second data bit
char 8: third data bit
char 9: final data bit

IMU R XXXX => read IMU data
MOT W XXXX => write to motor

"XXXX" corresponds to base 10 values, ie. "W09999" writes 9999 to the throttle output
"____" corresponds to ignored entries. These may not be newline characters. 

All commands are echoed if accepted. For read commands, the read value is substituted into the return message,
i.e. "W01111" -> "R0____" would be echoed "R01111" after the previous command if output as enabled. 

Commands:
Writing:
W0XXX: write to throttle output, XXX corresponds to three entries. Valid range: TBD
W1XXX: write to steering output, XXX corresponds to three entries. Valid range: TBD
WW___: enable output
WR___: disable output

Reading:
R0XXXX: read throttle output
R1XXXX: read steering output
RW___: check if output is enabled, returns WA001 if so and WA000 otherwise
